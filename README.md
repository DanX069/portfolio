# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website. As a college student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering, I built this portfolio to showcase my skills, projects in CSE.

## Sections
The website is divided into several sections:

1. **Introduction:** A brief introduction about who I am, what I'm studying, and what I'm passionate about in the field of CSE.
2. **Skills:** A rundown of my technical and soft skills.
3. **Projects:** This section showcases the projects I've completed during my time at college, as well as any personal projects. Each project includes a brief description and a link to the project's GitHub repository.
4. **Contact:** Contact information and links to my professional social networks like LinkedIn and GitHub.

## Tech Stack
This website is built using React.js and Bootstrap for the frontend. CSS is used for additional styling.
